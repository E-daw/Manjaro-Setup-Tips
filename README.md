PSA for Firefox users: set MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1 to enable macOS-like smooth scrolling

Firefox scrolling fix from reddit:

I've been annoyed for a while that Firefox only supports the kind of two finger scrolling where moving the fingers on the touch pad a decent amount emits a scroll wheel event. I just now found out that if you start Firefox with the environment variable MOZ_USE_XINPUT2 set to 1, it will use xinput 2, and support actual smooth touch pad scrolling.

I know this works for Firefox 55 or newer, but don't know the earliest version which supports it. I assume it will be enabled by default at some point, but it isn't yet in Firefox 58 (the current nightly).

    Run this command:

    echo export MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1 | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/use-xinput2.sh

    Log out and back in.

    Firefox should now use xinput 2.

    (optional) Open Firefox and go to about:preferences -> Advanced (or about:preferences -> Browsing for Firefox Nightly), and uncheck "Use smooth scrolling". This disables the old style "smooth scrolling", which just causes an annoying delay when using xinput2 style scrolling imo.
